██████ [head=3]Subject: Restricted Access of Synthetic Units to Psychology Office [/head]

I am writing to formally request that all Research Division personnel—including Robotics—be reminded of a critical standing protocol regarding synthetic units and the Psychology office.

It is imperative that cyborgs are explicitly instructed never to enter the Psychology office or use it as a shortcut to access maintenance tunnels or other areas of the station. The space is designated as a confidential therapeutic environment, and its integrity relies on uninterrupted privacy. As per NT policy, the office is exempt from surveillance systems, including cameras and AI communication relays, to ensure clients feel safe, undisturbed, and free to speak without oversight.

The intrusion of a borg—regardless of task or intent—during an active session poses a significant risk to psychological safety, trust, and recovery. Such incidents can cause harm, undermine therapy, and violate both medical ethics and NT confidentiality directives.

I ask that this policy be reiterated to all relevant staff and that newly constructed or reassigned cyborgs be briefed on this restriction during activation or programming.

Thank you for your understanding and for your continued support in maintaining high professional standards aboard the station.

Respectfully,
Nebulon
Station Psychologist
