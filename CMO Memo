In the course of station operations, personnel often sustain serious injuries that can extend beyond the physical. While medical intervention is crucial for immediate survival and recovery, the psychological aftermath of trauma should not be overlooked.

I would like to kindly remind Medical Command that crew members recovering from grievous injuries—or those who have endured prolonged or particularly distressing medical events—may benefit from a follow-up psychological consultation. Addressing potential emotional or mental strain early can support long-term recovery, reduce the risk of operational burnout, and promote overall station resilience.

Should any such cases arise, I remain available to assist in evaluating and supporting affected personnel. I trust your judgment in identifying those who might benefit from this service, and I appreciate your continued collaboration in maintaining the crew’s well-being.

Respectfully,
