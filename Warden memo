██████ [head=3]Subject: Referral of Offenders for Psychological Evaluation [/head]

[/color]──────────────────────────────────────────
It is well-documented that a significant proportion of criminal behavior aboard stations—and indeed, in broader society—can be linked to untreated psychological or emotional issues. As such, I would like to remind Security Command that psychological support is a resource available not only for the general crew, but also for those who have engaged in disruptive or criminal activity.

Where appropriate, I encourage the Warden and security staff to consider referring detained individuals for psychological evaluation or counseling sessions. Early intervention may reduce the likelihood of repeat offenses and improve overall station morale and safety.

I am available for consultations throughout the shift. If an individual demonstrates signs of psychological distress, erratic behavior, or seems to be acting out due to underlying issues, please do not hesitate to involve me.

Thank you for your time and cooperation.

Nebulon
